# CppPerformanceStudy_UseCPUCacheProperties
This small project demonstrates differences during accessing 2 dimensional arrays in 2 loops, when outer loop is iteratinging over rows or columns. This is also a good example of applying Object Oriented Programming in order to avoid code duplication by classes polymorphism.

Please read the description of this project on my [github.io](https://vperepos.github.io/Projects/#c-performance-study-use-cpu-cache-properties) site.
